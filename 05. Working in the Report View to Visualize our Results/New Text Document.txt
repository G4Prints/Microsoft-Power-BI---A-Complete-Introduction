After completing the project and the assignments you really have a great knowledge of the powerful features of Power BI Desktop. There might still be some awesome functions though, that can be a big help in your daily work which we didn't cover so far.

For this purpose, I created some videos related to these functions on our YouTube channel, so feel free to have look if you want to find out more about one of the following topics:
